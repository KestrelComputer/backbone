# backbone
Backbone provides a backplane-based research and development platform for developing individual pieces of the Kestrel-3 and perhaps even other home-made, open-source computing devices.

See also my [Hackaday.io Project Page](https://hackaday.io/project/11928-backbone-bus) for the bus standard itself.
Refer to my [Hackaday.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/10035-kestrel-computer-project) for the Kestrel-3 computer I intend on using it with.
For longer-form updates (more infrequent), refer to [my blog](https://kestrelcomputer.github.io/kestrel).
